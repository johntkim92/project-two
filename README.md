# Project Two - John

Technologies Used:
HTML, CSS, JS, Node, Express, Mongoose, various other middleware.

Approach taken:
The first thing I did was map out a rough draft of what my site should look like as well as what content the pages should display. Then I wrote about the potential problems that I will come across and would later go back to the problems and drawings and refer to them and use them as a sort of checklist. I also wrote down the steps that I would have to go through to fix the problems and I found that writing things out like that made the coding portion go more smoothly. I set to-do lists, but unfortunately, I wasn't able to accomplish everything that I had hoped to do.

Unsolved Problems/ What I'd like to work on in the future:
Right now, even though the website is fully functional, I would really like to make it look good. There are also added features that I would like to include like a logout button, sorting by comments, and the ability to only give upvotes or downvotes only once per user. The amount of time that I spend styling versus the intended outcome seems inversely proportional. I regret using bootstrap even though it allowed me to have a nice navbar, it created a lot of problems in the end because I had to try and override its css and locate the problem instead of just being able to implement my own and have it work right away. Also I wasn't able to implement JQuery because I didn't think I needed it for my website to be functional.
